I am a Computer Science PhD student at Indiana University Bloomington. I am interested in mathematical and logical foundations, constructive mathematics, (dependent) type theory, category theory, programming langauages and proof assistants. My current areas of reasearch include (but are not limited to) Homotopy Type Theory/Univalent Foundations (HoTT/UF), Order Theory and (Univalent) Category Theory.
